# œÅbot

This is the code for a simple discord bot.

## Getting started

Ensure you have [node]() installed.

Clone the repository and run to pull the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a new `creds.yaml` file in the directory to hold the bot's token. To get the token either [reach out to me](https://github.com/xpcoffee) or [set up your own Discord bot account](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications).

```yaml
# creds.yaml
token: <the token>
```

To run the server, run the following from within the directory:

```bash
node .
```
